# MinimalAPIsTemplate
A comprehensive and fully functional ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs template, with lots of ready-to-go examples, including CQRS and Mediator patterns, middlewares, first-party and third-parties packages, OAuth 2.0 Authentication using JSON Web Algorithms and Tokens (JWA, JWT, JWS, JWE) Bearer.  

### NuGet link:

## Examples of services and middlewares in this template:  
- **Architecture** based on the Minimal APIs concept, with endpoints and route handlers, to easily implement Mediator, CQRS and Event-Sourcing patterns and Microservices architectures  
- Asynchronous service calls with **Dependency Injection (DI)** for Singleton, Transient and Scoped services  
- **Authentication** with JWT, JWS, JWE and JOSE  
- **Authorization** with additional custom policies using Authorization Handler
- **CQRS** pattern to separates queries (read) and commands (write) operations on data into two different models  
- **Dapper** ORM for mapping SQL to objects and viceversa, with common **SQL** language and **SqlClient's SqlConnection**  
- **Docker** container deployment  
- **Entity Framework Core** for mapping SQL to objects and viceversa, with **LINQ** and **DbContextFactory**  
- **Exception Handler** and error handling
- **Fluent Validation** for validating models and JSON body input  
- **GZip Stream** compression and decompression  
- **Hangfire** batch and job automations  
- **HealthChecks** health monitoring  
- **HSTS** and **HTTPS** redirection  
- **HttpClientFactory** with HTTP connection pooling  
- **MediatR** for decoupling, reduce boilerplate code, and easy implement **Mediator**, **CQRS**, **Event-Sourcing** patterns  
- **Multiple Environments** usage (Development, Staging, Production and custom)  
- **NLog** and JSON console and DB logs  
- **OpenAPI Swagger** using **Swashbuckle**, with Schemas, API definitions, authentication button etc.  
- **StopWatch** for benchmarks and timing running methods  

## AuthN and AuthZ examples ready-to-go:  
- JWT unsigned and not encrypted for basic knowledge  
- JWS ("alg": "HS512") signed with HMAC SHA-512 using a symmetric key  
- JWS ("alg": "RS512") signed with RSA SHA-512 using a X509 Certificate asymmetric key  
- JWE ("enc": "A256CBC-HS512", "alg": "dir") encrypted with AES256 using a symmetric key and signed with HMAC SHA-512 using a symmetric key  
- JWE ("enc": "A256CBC-HS512", "alg": "dir") encrypted with AES256 using a symmetric key and signed with RSA SHA-512 using a X509 Certificate asymmetric key  
- JOSE ("enc": "A256CBC-HS512", "alg": "RSA-OAEP") encrypted with RSA-OAEP using a X509 Certificate asymmetric key and signed with RSA-SSA-PSS-SHA512 using another X509 Certificate asymmetric key  
- Test API for Login, Authentication and Authorization with one of the generated Bearer token  
  
# How to use token examples  
1. Call a generate token method and copy the returned Bearer token *token*  
2. Log in clicking the Authorize green button in the Swagger UI and enter the value: "Bearer *token*" (without double quotes, replace *token* with its value)  
3. Call tryToken method. You will get 200 if authenticated, 401 otherwise  

## How to generate a PFX certificate
If you want to manually generate a .pfx file, you can use the following OpenSSL commands, then copy it to the Certificates folder of the project:  

```
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out sign-key.pem 2048  
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -outform pem -key sign-key.pem -days 365 -out sign-cert.pem  
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.pem  
```

## How to generate NLog table  
You can use the following T-SQL command to generate a table working with this NLog example:  

```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[NLog] (
    [ID]        INT            IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
    [Logged]    DATETIME       NULL,
    [Level]     NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL,
    [Message]   NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL,
    [Logger]    NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL,
    [Callsite]  NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL,
    [Exception] NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([ID] ASC)
);
```

# FAQ
### When sending a JWT (more properly a JWS) from microservice A to microservice B, should microservice A sign the token using: its own public key, or its own private key, or microservice B's public key, or microservice B's private key?

Microservice A should sign the token using its own private key. The digital signature is used to verify the integrity of the token and to prove that it was sent from a trustworthy source. When microservice A sends the JWT to B, it signs the token with its own private key to prove that it was sent by A and that the contents of the token have not been altered during transmission. Microservice B can then verify the signature using A's public key. This way, B can be sure that the token was sent by A and that the contents of the token have not been altered during transmission.

### When sending a JWT (more properly a JWE) from microservice A to microservice B, should microservice A encrypt the token using: its own public key, or its own private key, or microservice B's public key, or microservice B's private key?

Microservice A should encrypt the token using microservice B's public key. Encryption is used to protect sensitive data inside the token during transmission from A to B. In an asymmetric encryption system, the public key is used to encrypt data and verify the signature, while the private key is used to decrypt data and sign the token. When microservice A sends the JWT to B, it should encrypt the token using B's public key so that only B, possessing the corresponding private key, can decrypt the sensitive data.

In summary, microservice A should sign the JWT using its own private key, and microservice B should verify the signature using A's public key. Microservice A should encrypt the JWT using B's public key and only B, possessing the corresponding private key, will be able to decrypt the sensitive data.
